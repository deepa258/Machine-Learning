This is because the RMSE and R-Squared values obtained in the cross-validation design show that Ridge Regression is performing better and has a better fit to the model data than the Linear Regression."

    "The mean RMSE value of Ridge Regression is slightly better (lower) than Linear Regression and the R-Squared values of Ridge Regression are slightly better (higher) than the Linear Regression. This shows that Ridge Regression has better performance on the data and can do a better job at predicting the value of the response variable (the median value of homes) using all the explanatory variables. In Ridge Regression, as the Alpha value increases, the R-Squared increases and RMSE value decreases which is an indication that it reduces overfitting on the data but as is seen in the case of a very high alpha value (500), the RMSE has increased which shows the underfitting of data."
